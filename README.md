# Source Code Vulnerability Analyzer

A lightweight static analysis tool built for our Software Engineering course project. This tool scans Python source code for common security vulnerabilities, categorizes them by severity, and produces both summary and detailed reports.

---

## Project Overview

The analyzer reads source files or entire project directories, parses them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and runs a set of detection rules. Each finding is assigned a severity (High, Medium, Low) and written to a human-readable report. Future enhancements will support additional output formats (JSON, HTML) and expanded rule sets.

---

## Features (v1 scope)

* Analyze a single file or a full project directory
* Parse Python code into AST for more precise detection (fewer false positives)
* Apply a base set of vulnerability rules:

  * Hardcoded credentials
  * Dangerous `exec()` usage
  * Insecure SQL concatenation
  * Weak cryptography
  * Broad exception handling
* Assign and summarize findings by severity
* Generate text reports with both summary and detailed sections

---

## Planned Enhancements

* Optional output formats: JSON and HTML
* Support for custom rule sets
* Expanded rules beyond the base five

| Requirement (from Needs Statement)                    | Implemented in UML / Code Design                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Analyze files or full project directories             | `Analyzer.analyzeFile`, `Analyzer.analyzePath`        |
| Parse code into structured form (AST)                 | `Parser` / `PythonParser`                             |
| Detect 5 vulnerability categories                     | `Rule` subclasses (5 base rules)                      |
| Assign severity to findings                           | `Rule.severity`, `Finding.severity`                   |
| Generate human-readable report with summary + details | `Reporter.toText`, `ScanResult` + `Finding`           |
| Provide summary by severity and category              | `ScanResult.bySeverity()`, `byCategory()`             |
| Document rules with descriptions + recommendations    | `Rule.description`, `Rule.recommendation`             |
| Planned JSON/HTML outputs                             | `Reporter.toJSON`, `Reporter.toHTML`                  |
| Ensure repeatable/verifiable outputs                  | `RunInfo` metadata (timestamp, toolVersion, rootPath) |
